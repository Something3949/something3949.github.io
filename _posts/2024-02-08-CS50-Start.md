# Hello
Today I didn't get much done, it was largely fighting with the command line while I tried to figure out why things weren't working. Also did a little bit of stuf ffor leadership.

# What I Did
- Started the CS50 edX course
    - Wrotea sipmle program in C and got it to complie
    - More ipmortantly, learned hwo to properly install things that I needed to compile that code which took a bit
    - Set-up a Leadership calendar and doc to summarize thigns from a meeting, completely unrelated though
