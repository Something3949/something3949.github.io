# Hi

I've used markdown before, I use it as my primary note taking method with Obsidian, I love all the backlinking features and what not. It is also what all of these pages are written in. It's suppsoed to be quicker than HTML, and I'd have to agree

## What I did Today
- Learned more about the syntax used by jekyll's markdown stuff
- Figured out how to publish to github pages, meaning that this websit enow can be accessed online, like a website
- Setup landing page with actual content
    - Figured out that I can change the index page and have those changes stay even after the website is rebuilt. I just have to change the home layout template
