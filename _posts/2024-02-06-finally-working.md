# Hi
It may have taken several days, but the website is finally accessciable from somewhere other than my local device. This means that the journals I've been writing are no longer just for my own pleasure.



# What I Did Today
- Finally got the Github Pages working, with a theme
    - Turns out that I just spelt a name wrong
- Wrote a step-by-step guide for myself on how to porperly commit things to this repository, so I now can upload these journals from a command line using git
- Quick Test
