# Hello
Today I finished setting up docker, downloaded the proper container that was listed in the Cryptohack stie so that I would have access to the proper Python modules that I would need. I also learned more about notebooks, not sure who made them but I know that they're used a lot in cloud computing and they run my python code significantly quicker than the regular compiler, so I like it.

## What I Did
- Downloaded Docker & Portainer
- Setup Docker, Portainer, and the Notebook Container to Run at Startup
- Made sure that all the packages were properly running (needed to convert from long to bytes)
