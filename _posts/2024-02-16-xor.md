# Hello
Today was more or less the same as yesterday, less troubleshooting. Things are finally working as expected, packages aren't fighting with me anymore acting like they're missing which is extremely appreciated. Worked through a few more levels on Cryptohack

## What I Did
- Worked through mroe levels on Cryptohack
- Started working on learning xor which doesn't really seem all too complicated (so far, in a few days I'm sure I'll be 100% lost, not just 90%)
