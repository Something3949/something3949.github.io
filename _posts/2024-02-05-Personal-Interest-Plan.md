# Hi There

I'm Devon, and I have spent the last day and a half or so getting this working so I can present my Personal Interest plans while working with markdown files

I didn't make all of this myselff, I'm using jekyll and github pages which simplifies things substantially, and even this whole theme is open-source, no-style-please. Some would call it ugly, but I like it.

This is the first log in the list, so it will probably look ver different from whatever it is that I end up making down the line

## What I Did Today
- Learn how to add themes to a jekyll blog
- Added this no-style-please theme to this blog
- Learned how to edit, change, and add new content to the index page
- Figured out how the website's file-system is handeled, and what needs to go where in order for me to be able to access it
