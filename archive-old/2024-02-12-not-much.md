# Hello
Today I didn't really do anything. I started working through some cybersecurity stuff before leaving about 15 minutes into class to try and get a Social Insurance Number

## What I Did
- Start working through some Cybersecurity Stuff
    - Found a website with introductory "courses" to Cybersecurity concepts, Cryptohack
    - Also went through some online Cybersecurity stuff
