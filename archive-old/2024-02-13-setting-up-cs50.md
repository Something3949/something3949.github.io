# Hello
Today was largely spent on one task, I was working through the online CS50 course, and I ran into an issue of missing some requise tneeded to actually compile the code. So, for the entire class I was basically troubleshooting and trying to figure out why things weren't working. 

Troubleshooting is going to be something that happens a lot
