# Hi
Today I finally started actually oging through the content and materials found in Cryptohack. I solved a few problems and figured out how to call some python functions that converted things between hex, ascii, and regular text. It was really fun.

## What I did
- Became more comfortable with Python syntax through practice problems in Cryptohack
- Started working through the Cryptohack introductory module
- Started the setup for Docker, but didn't get too far in
